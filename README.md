This repository demonstrates the difference between High Coupling and Low Coupling in Java. High Coupling occurs when classes are tightly dependent on each other, making the code harder to modify, test, and maintain. In contrast, Low Coupling reduces dependencies by using techniques like Dependency Injection, improving flexibility, reusability, and maintainability. The HighCoupling.java example shows a Car class that directly creates an Engine instance, while the LowCoupling.java example decouples them by passing the Engine instance to the Car class via a constructor. This illustrates best practices for writing scalable and modular Java applications.
